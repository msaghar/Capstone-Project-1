<h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
<p><h3>— Introduction & Background</h3><br />
Hello, my name is Maseeh Saghar, and I’m a dedicated computer science student with a passion for building practical, real-world solutions through code. My journey in tech started with curiosity about how systems work under the hood, and over time, that curiosity evolved into a deep interest in programming, operating systems, and problem-solving. I thrive in hands-on learning environments where I can experiment, test ideas, and refine my skills through actual projects.

<p><h3>— Skills & Areas of Expertise</h3><br />
My work spans across C programming, UNIX utilities, file system development, and concurrency projects. I’m experienced in designing and implementing low-level systems, building tools from scratch, and optimizing processes for performance. Beyond technical skills, I value clarity, organization, and collaboration—whether that’s writing well-structured code, explaining concepts to peers, or working together to debug complex problems. I aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice, turning classroom concepts into robust, working applications.

<p><h3>— Goals & Personal Philosophy</h3><br />
I believe in continuous growth—each project is an opportunity to learn something new and push myself beyond my comfort zone. My goal is to contribute to innovative and impactful technology solutions, whether in software development, network security, or systems design. Outside of coding, I’m committed to developing problem-solving strategies, improving my workflow, and exploring emerging tech trends. For me, technology isn’t just a career—it’s a craft I’m constantly refining.</p>
